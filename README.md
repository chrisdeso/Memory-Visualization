# Stack and Heap Memory Visualization Tool

A simple visualization tool that helps you see what's happening in memory for small C++ programs. For CS3339 (Computer Architecture) at Texas State University - Spring 2025.

## What does this do?

Memory management is one of those computer science concepts that's super important but really hard to understand because you can't *see* it. This tool fixes that problem by showing you:

- How stack frames get created and destroyed during function calls
- Where local variables live on the stack
- What happens when you use `new` and `delete` for dynamic memory
- How memory leaks happen (and how to spot them!)

## Why did we make this?

To visualize memory allocation

## Features

- Visual representation of stack and heap memory
- Step-by-step visualization of memory operations
- Color-coded memory blocks to identify different types and states
- Simple examples to demonstrate key memory concepts
